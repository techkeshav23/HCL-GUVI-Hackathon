Problem Statement 1
AI-Generated Voice Detection (Tamil, English, Hindi, Malayalam, Telugu)
1. Introduction
AI systems can now generate very realistic human-like voices. Because of this, it is difficult to identify whether a voice recording was spoken by a real human or generated by an AI system.
In this problem, students must build an API-based solution that detects whether a given voice sample is AI-generated or Human, across five supported languages.
2. Supported Languages (Fixed)
Your system must support only these five languages:
Tamil
English
Hindi
Malayalam
Telugu
Each request will contain one audio file in one of the above languages.
3. What You Need to Build
You must design and deploy a REST API that:
Accepts one MP3 audio file at a time
Audio will be sent only as Base64
Analyzes the voice
Returns whether the voice is:
AI_GENERATED
HUMAN
Responds in JSON format
Is protected using an API Key
4. Input Rules
Audio format: MP3
Input type: Base64 encoded
One audio per request
Audio must not be modified
5. API Authentication
Your API must validate an API Key sent in request headers.
API Key Header Format
x-api-key: YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY
Requests without a valid API key must be rejected.
6. API Request (cURL Example)
Endpoint Example
POST https://your-domain.com/api/voice-detection
cURL Request Example
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/voice-detection \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: sk_test_123456789" \
  -d '{
    "language": "Tamil",
    "audioFormat": "mp3",
    "audioBase64": "SUQzBAAAAAAAI1RTU0UAAAAPAAADTGF2ZjU2LjM2LjEwMAAAAAAA..."
  }'



7. Request Body Fields
Field
Description
language
Tamil / English / Hindi / Malayalam / Telugu
audioFormat
Always mp3
audioBase64
Base64-encoded MP3 audio

8. API Response Body (Success)
Example Response
{
  "status": "success",
  "language": "Tamil",
  "classification": "AI_GENERATED",
  "confidenceScore": 0.91, // out of 1.0
  "explanation": "Unnatural pitch consistency and robotic speech patterns detected"
}
9. Response Field Explanation
Field
Meaning
status
success or error
language
Language of the audio
classification
AI_GENERATED or HUMAN
confidenceScore
Value between 0.0 and 1.0
explanation
Short reason for the decision

10. Classification Rules (Strict)
Only one classification field is required:
AI_GENERATED → Voice created using AI or synthetic systems
HUMAN → Voice spoken by a real human
👉 voiceSource is removed because it is logically the same as classification.
11. Error Response Example
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Invalid API key or malformed request"
}
12. Evaluation Process
System sends one Base64 MP3 per request
Language will be one of the 5 supported languages
Your API analyzes the voice
JSON response is returned
Multiple requests are made for evaluation

13. Evaluation Criteria
Participants will be evaluated on:
🎯 Accuracy of AI vs Human detection
🌍 Consistency across all 5 languages
📦 Correct request & response format
⚡ API reliability and response time
🧠 Quality of explanation
14. Rules & Constraints
❌ Hard-coding results is strictly prohibited
❌ Misuse of data leads to disqualification
⚠️ External detection APIs may be restricted
✅ Ethical and transparent AI usage is mandatory
15. One-Line Summary
Build a secure REST API that accepts one Base64-encoded MP3 voice in Tamil, English, Hindi, Malayalam, or Telugu and correctly identifies whether it is AI-generated or Human.
